MyVim is a VIM-like text editor based on the Python 3 programming language that meets the following requirements:

1. The program is developed using the MVC architectural design pattern.
2. The program must have a TUI. The curses module built into Python was used to develop TUI.
3. The program works with a 1-byte text encoding.
4. To work with text, a wrapper was used on top of the independently developed myString class.
5. The program must have the operating modes shown in the "help.txt".
